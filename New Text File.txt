AMQP scheduling message delivery
An AMQP message can provide scheduling information that controls the time in the future when the message will be delivered at the earliest. This information is provided by adding a message annotation to the sent message.

There are two different message annotations that can be used to schedule a message for later delivery:

x-opt-delivery-time The specified value must be a positive long corresponding to the time the message should be made available for delivery (in milliseconds).

x-opt-delivery-delay The specified value must be a positive long corresponding to the amount of milliseconds after the broker receives the given message before it should be made available for delivery.

If both annotations are present in the same message then the broker will prefer the more specific x-opt-delivery-time value.
